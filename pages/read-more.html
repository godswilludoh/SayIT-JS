        <h4 class="blog_content-heading">Case of Whistleblowing in the University of Nigeria</h4>
        <p class="blog_content-body">Education fraud occurs when a school or university violates
          federally mandated standards or the Higher Education Act (HEA) to
          increase profits. Ruthless administrators cheat the system by
          enrolling more students or cutting costs. These schemes will
          eventually exert their burden on taxpayers as unqualified students
          whose grades were artificially inflated will fail to repay their
          loans. Blowing the whistle against this type of fraudulent
          practices help the government uncover those who prey on youths who
          want to receive an education to improve their lives.
